## General info
The goal of the application is to let users record their hike waypoints easily and quickly, calculate distance, pace, store personal records and plan future trips without revisiting the same hiking spots.	
The user picks a starting hike waypoint and then can enter as many other waypoints as they like. When a current waypoint is selected, it limits available waypoints to only those that match real life available paths. In this way selecting next waypoints is much faster and the user has to choose from only few available options instead of selecting from the whole pack of existing waypoints.
After the hike is finished, the application calculates real distance traveled, the pace and elevation.
For now on the application covers an area of Karkonosze mountains shown below:
